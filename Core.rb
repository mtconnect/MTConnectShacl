All actions change the universe in some fashion. That is, they have outcomes, whether desired ones or not. Since desired outcomes are reasons for the existence of an action specification, we might argue that all action specifications are, in fact, plan specifications, with desired outcomes as objectives. However, our intent here is to capture instances of action specifications wherein objectives or desired outcomes are not explicitly stated and to delinate 'plan specifications' as cases where the objectives and the corresponding actions are explicitly stated. This is why the class is asserted directly under the information content entity.\n\n3. Although not formalized at this stage, an action specification may prescribe a kind of process in more detail by prescribing the sequence of actions one or more participants are to do or by prescribing the actions persons bearing various roles are to do in bringing about the process. The latter would be relevant in situations where a particular participant bears two (or even more roles) in a process. An example of the latter would be a particular shop floor worker bearing and realizing both the role of the operator and that of the inspector as prescribed by some action specification and as realized in today's occurrences of some punch-press process.\n\n4.  Action specification can be used together with plan specification to create a hierarchy of work instruction composition.",

Condition here would encompass BFO: specifically-dependent continuants (qualities, dispositions and other realizable entities types) as well as site (the absolute or relative location of a material entity). In the future, the coverage will be expanded to include some currently \"missing dependent entity types\"; including orientation, and cases wherein a material entity is in a particular condition because it has or is in particular composition or configuration (e.g. the setup action of a machine and jig is complete and it is not in a setup/ready-for-run state). \n\n2. Unchanging, is intended to encompass not just having a particular condition for the duration of the state, but potentially being value-bound to some constant or even within a given range as prescribed by some design or requirement specification. Specialized sub-types may be introduced to handle such value-based constant and range-bound states and conditions.\n\n3. The term as introduced here is not intended to be used for modeling what we might call the \"state of a process\" (e.g., equilibrium state for chemical, physical and biological processes or steady-state or discrete or continuous production processes), nor for modeling the states of non-real entities (e.g., virtual entities participating in virtual simulation program and any other informational or abstract entities, when they are considered to be in a particular condition).

Therefore, the date-time asserted (i.e., ‘has date-time instant value’ of the ‘temporal instant value expression’ that ‘is value expression of at all times’ of the ‘temporal instant’) for the first instant should be before the last instant in terms their positions in the corresponding calendar and clock system. For example, the first instant and last instant of a ‘temporal interval’ are 2002-10-10T17:00:00Z and 2002-10-11T01:40:00Z. \n2. If only one date-time is available for the interval due to lack of data or an interval being smaller than the tick time (the smallest duration by which the time progresses) then the date-time should be asserted either only for first instant or only for last instant of every interval uniformly for the entire knowledge base. For example, Barack Obama gained the role of presidency on 20 January 2009 should be modeled as the process p of type ‘gain of role’ ‘occupies temporal region’ r (a ‘temporal interval’) which ‘has last instant’ i (a ‘temporal instant’) which ‘has value expression at all times’ v (a ‘temporal instant value expression’) which ‘has data-time value’ 2009-01-20T00:00:00Z."
